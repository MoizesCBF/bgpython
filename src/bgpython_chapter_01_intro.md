## Email Policy

I'm generally available to help out with \index{email to Beej} email questions
so feel free to write in, but I can't guarantee a response. I lead a pretty
busy life and there are times when I just can't answer a question you have. When
that's the case, I usually just delete the message. It's nothing personal; I
just won't ever have the time to give the detailed answer you require.

As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to respond. If
you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be sure to include any
pertinent information (like platform, compiler, error messages you're getting,
and anything else you think might help me troubleshoot), you're much more likely
to get a response. For more pointers, read ESR's document, [How To Ask
Questions The Smart
Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)^[http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html].

If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the answer, and
if it's still elusive, then write me again with the information you've found and
hopefully it will be enough for me to help out.

Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd just like to
let you know that I _fully_ appreciate all the praise the guide has received
over the years. It's a real morale boost, and it gladdens me to hear that it is
being used for good! `:-)` Thank you!

## Dedication

Thanks to everyone who has helped in the past and future with me getting this
guide written. And thank you to all the people who produce the Free software and
packages that I use to make the Guide: GNU, Linux, Slackware, vim, Python,
Inkscape, pandoc, many others. And finally a big thank-you to the literally
thousands of you who have written in with suggestions for improvements and words
of encouragement.

I dedicate this guide to some of my biggest heroes and inpirators in the world
of computers: Donald Knuth, Bruce Schneier, W. Richard Stevens, and The Woz, my
Readership, and the entire Free and Open Source Software Community.

loaded with GNU tools. The cover "art" and diagrams are produced with Inkscape.
The Markdown is converted to HTML and LaTex/PDF by pandoc and xeLaTex, using
